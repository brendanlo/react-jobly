# Jobly Frontend
Jobly is a job board for viewing job postings and the companies that are posting them. 

## Description
The Jobly frontend is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The primary purpose of the app is to explore designing and implementing reusable React components.
